<!-- Output: -->

<!-- How this code run logic behind that expalain -->
<!-- In this code, we are taking a number n as input from the user. We are then iterating from 2 to n. For each number i, we are checking if it is prime or not. We are checking this by iterating from 2 to i/2. If i is divisible by any number between 2 and i/2, then it is not a prime number. If i is not divisible by any number between 2 and i/2, then it is a prime number. We are printing all the prime numbers in the interval from 2 to n. -->
